# ðŸ¤˜Learning JavaScript 

This repository contains my studies in JavaScript, programming logic, and algorithms. Here you will find notes, practical examples, and exercises I developed to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Repository Structure

- **JavaScript Basics:**
  - Basic syntax
  - Variables and data types
  - Operators
  - Control structures (if/else, switch, loops)

- **Programming Logic:**
  - Step-by-step problem solving
  - Flowcharts and pseudocode
  - Conditionals and loops

- **Algorithms:**
  - Introduction to algorithms
  - Sequential, conditional, and repetitive structures
  - Practical exercises with solutions


## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Main language for the studies.
